# README

Remember you need to start with ```rails new _name_ -d mysql```; and ```bundle install``` once inside the created directory (much like a git clone). Remember to use ```bundle exec _cmd_``` if a command doesn't work. Use ```rails server``` to start the server. ```rails generate server welcome index``` will generate a controller.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
